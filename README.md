# End-to-End Machine Learning Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for an end-to-end machine learning project. The goal of this project is [state your project goal here].

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
- `models/`: Contains trained machine learning models.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `src/`: Source code for the machine learning pipeline.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all dependencies required to run the project.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_project.git
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Explore the notebooks:**

    Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and open the Jupyter notebooks to understand the data and the machine learning pipeline.

4. **Train models:**

    Use the provided notebooks or run the scripts in the `src/` directory to train machine learning models.

5. **Evaluate models:**

    Evaluate the trained models using the evaluation metrics provided in the notebooks or scripts.

6. **Deploy models (optional):**

    If needed, deploy the trained models to production using the provided deployment scripts.
